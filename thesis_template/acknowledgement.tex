I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisor, Professor Li Man Chun, Martin. As an enthusiastic researcher as well as a dedicated educator, his academic passion and responsibility have been constantly encouraging me to work harder. The completion of my dissertation would not have been possible without his guidance and nurturing.

I would also like to extend my thanks to the staff from the department of mathematics for their consistent help. I am particularly grateful for the administrative assistance given by Miss Pauline Chan.

Finally, I would like to express my very great appreciation to my parents and Miss Wang, Jiaqi for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout my postgraduate study.
