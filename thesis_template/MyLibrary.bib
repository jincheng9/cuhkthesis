 abstract = {Kenneth Brakke studies in general dimensions a dynamic system of surfaces of no inertial mass driven by the force of surface tension and opposed by a frictional force proportional to velocity. He formulates his study in terms of varifold surfaces and uses the methods of geometric measure theory to develop a mathematical description of the motion of a surface by its mean curvature. This mathematical description encompasses, among other subtleties, those of changing geometries and instantaneous mass losses.Originally published in 1978.ThePrinceton Legacy Libraryuses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These paperback editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.},

	abstract = {In this work we study the behaviour of compact, smooth, immersed manifolds with boundary which move under the mean curvature flow in Euclidian space. We thereby prescribe the Neumann boundary condition in a purely geometric manner by requiring a vertical contact angle between the unit normal fields of the immersions and a given, smooth hypersurface∑. We deduce a very sharp local gradient bound depending only on the curvature of the immersions and∑. Combining this with a short time existence result, we obtain the existence of a unique solution to any given smooth initial and boundary data. This solution either exists for anyt{\textgreater}0 or on a maximal finite time interval [0,T] such that the curvature explodes ast→T.},

We study the long time evolution of compact, smooth, immersed manifolds with boundary which move under the mean curvature flow in Euclidian space. On the boundary, a Neumann condition is prescribed in a purely geometric manner by requiring a vertical contact angle between the unit normal fields of the immersions and a given, smooth hypersurfaceΣ. We deduce estimates for the curvature of the immersions and, in a special case, we obtain a precise description of the possible singularities.},
