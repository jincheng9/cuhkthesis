AB  - Consider an arbitrary closed, countably n-rectifiable set in a strictly convex $$(n+1)$$-dimensional domain, and suppose that the set has finite n-dimensional Hausdorff measure and the complement is not connected. Starting from this given set, we show that there exists a non-trivial Brakke flow with fixed boundary data for all times. As $$t \uparrow \infty $$, the flow sequentially converges to non-trivial solutions of Plateauâ€™s problem in the setting of stationary varifolds.
